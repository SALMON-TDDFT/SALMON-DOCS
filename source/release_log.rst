Details of Minor Changes
------------------------

Followings are history of fixed bugs and changes of models/inputs/outputs after releasing v.2.0.0. (not complete list currently)

Fixed bugs
==========

(Fixed in v.2.0.2)

* Small noise on the total energy in TDDFT calculation (that is seen with weak pulse around e.g. I=1d9 W/cm2) has been removed.
* The printed absolute values of electron density in cube format has been fixed.. 
* Printing of the external field in TDDFT calculation of the isolated system has a bug in v.2.0.0 and v.2.0.1. It has been fixed in v.2.0.2.
* The file reading option of the external electric field in TDDFT calculation ("file_input1" in &emfield) has been fixed.
* Invalid occupation number printed in SYSNAME_ovlp.data file for projection option with non-uniform k-points has been fixed.

(Fixed in v.2.0.0)

* The imaginary part of wavefunction was not printed in cube format until v.1.2.1

(Fixed in v.?.?.?)

* Abnormal calculation that sometimes happens if zero value is included in the atomic coordinate in the input with "A_eV_fs" has been fiexd. 


Changes of models/inputs/outputs
================================

(v.2.0.2)

* The definition of the total energy of the periodic system printed in TDDFT calculation has changed: 
  The electric field energy is included until v.2.0.1. It has not been included from v.2.0.2. 
* The directory names generated by "method_wf_distributor=slice" option have changed from v.2.0.2.
